# 🛒 Retail Theft Analysis in Chicago (2001–2025)

## 📌 Project Overview
Retail theft is a growing concern in major cities like Chicago — affecting businesses, law enforcement, and communities. In this project, I analyzed 24 years of real crime data to uncover patterns in **where**, **when**, and **how** retail theft happens, and built predictive models to support smarter decision-making.

---

## ❓ What I Did 
I conducted an end-to-end data analysis and machine learning project focused on **retail theft trends** in Chicago. The goal was to explore:

- High-risk theft zones and time periods
- Store types most affected by theft
- Factors influencing arrest outcomes
- Future theft predictions using time-series and ML models

---

## ⚙️ How I Did It
To achieve this, I used the following tools and techniques:

### 🔧 Technologies Used:
- **Python (Google Colab)** – Data cleaning, EDA, ML, forecasting
- **Pandas, Seaborn, Folium, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Prophet, Statsmodels**
- **Tableau** – Visual storytelling with dashboards

### 🧠 Key Steps:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, formatted dates, standardized categories
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Theft frequency by store type, day of week, hour, month
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - **ARIMA** – Trend detection
  - **Facebook Prophet** – Seasonality forecasting
  - **LSTM** – Deep learning for complex time patterns
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Heatmaps and KMeans clustering for hotspot detection
- **Classification Models**:
  - **Random Forest & Logistic Regression** – Predict store vulnerability
  - **XGBoost** – Predict arrest likelihood
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard**: Summarized insights for non-technical audiences

---

## ✅ What It Led To
- 📅 Identified peak theft periods (2–4 PM, midweek, December & July)
- 📍 Detected high-risk theft zones in commercial and downtown areas
- 🏬 Found department stores and small retailers to be most vulnerable
- 👮 Predicted arrest likelihood using ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- 📊 Built a fully interactive **Tableau Dashboard** with theft trends, arrest breakdowns, and hotspot maps

---

## 💡 Recommendations
Based on my findings, I proposed **zero-cost, high-impact strategies**:
- Increase staff alertness during midweek afternoons
- Rearrange store layouts for better visibility in small stores
- Guide law enforcement patrols using historical hotspot trends

---

## 🌱 What I Gained
This project helped me:
- Turn a real-world problem into a data-driven solution
- Sharpen skills in **EDA, forecasting, ML modeling, and Tableau**
- Practice **storytelling through data** for business stakeholders
- Gain confidence to contribute in **real-world data analyst roles**
